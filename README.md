## 📖 ft\_transcendence

A web-based real-time multiplayer **Pong** game, built as part of the **42 School Common Core curriculum**. This project challenged us to explore unfamiliar technologies, develop real-time web applications, and integrate various gameplay, user management, and security features — all containerized via Docker.

## 🔐 Security Measures

Security was a top priority in the development of **ft\_transcendence**. The following mechanisms were implemented to safeguard user data, communication, and system integrity:

* **Password hashing** using **bcrypt**
* **Input validation and sanitization** to protect against:

  * SQL Injection (SQLi)
  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* **HTTPS enforced** across all communications (wss for WebSocket connections)
* **Google Sign-In OAuth 2.0 integration** for secure, streamlined authentication:

  * Users can log in with their Google account credentials via OAuth
  * Access tokens and user profile data handled securely following OAuth best practices
  * Safe token exchange and session handling

![Google sign in](./media/p7.png)

* **JWT-based authentication** with optional **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for enhanced user security

![2fa](./media/p4.png)

* **Environment variables and secrets** are securely stored using **HashiCorp Vault**:

  * API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data are encrypted and isolated from the codebase
  * Centralized secret management minimizes exposure and simplifies access control

![Google sign in](./media/p18.png)

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** powered by **ModSecurity**:

  * Hardened configuration to detect and block malicious traffic, such as:

    * Common web attacks (XSS, SQLi, CSRF)
    * Rate limiting for abuse prevention
    * Custom security rules for sensitive routes and APIs
* **Secure token handling** and **session management** with automatic token expiration and invalidation
* **Docker container isolation** and **network restrictions** to minimize attack surface

## 📊 WebSocket User Status Management Diagram

Here’s an ASCII-style diagram you can include:

```
                        +--------------------+
                        |    Web Application   |
                        |  (Frontend SPA)      |
                        +----------+-----------+
                                   |
                                   |  WebSocket (wss)
                                   |
                        +----------v-----------+
                        |    Socket Server     |
                        | (Fastify + Socket.io)|
                        +----------+-----------+
                                   |
           +-----------------------+----------------------+
           |                       |                      |
  +--------v-------+       +-------v--------+      +-------v-------+
  |  User A (Online)|       |  User B (Offline)|    |  User C (Online)|
  +----------------+       +-----------------+    +----------------+
          |                          |                     |
          +-----[online status]------+                     |
          |                                                |
          +------------------------------[friend list updates]

    (When a socket connects, user is marked 'Online' in DB or in-memory)
    (When disconnects, server updates to 'Offline' and broadcasts updates)
```

---

## 📌 Diagram Summary:

* **Web app SPA connects via secure WebSocket (`wss://`)**
* **Server tracks active sockets and marks users online/offline**
* **On connect/disconnect:**

  * Status is updated in DB (or memory)
  * Friends get live status updates via socket events
Great call — let’s succinctly describe that too! Here’s a clean, one-liner you can slot into your **Features** and **Notable Features** sections:

* **Match history tracking** — each user can view a personal log of their past games, opponents, scores, and match dates.

![Google sign in](./media/p15.png)


* **Random unique avatars** auto-assigned to new users at signup

* **Front-end displays real-time online/offline badges on friends list**
